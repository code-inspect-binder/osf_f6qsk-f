# Analysis code:

`analysis_exp1.R` contains the code for the analysis and plotting of Experiment 1. To run it requires some R packages and some extra functions contained in the additional script `BF_correlations.R`.

`analysis_exp2.R` contains the code for the analysis and plotting of Experiment 2. Some of the analyses requires a working installation of `rstan`, and they use the function defined in `BayesianGLM_functions.R` and the Stan code for the Bayesian probit model in `probit_blink.stan`.

For any question about the analyses drop a line to m.lisi {at} essex.ac.uk
